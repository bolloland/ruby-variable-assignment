 # Define a local variable called 'greeting',
 # give it the value of the string "Hello World"

greeting = "Hello World"


# Otherwise those changes wont register and your tests will fail. So while you had the right code there, the file wasnt saved, which is why the tests were still failing. 
# not sure if you have been trying to talk but i have volumn down on my com-i kw  for some reason my keyboard wasn't working it was in type-to-text or something


# i think in the pre-req labs, it saved automatically. so no idea. 
# i need some sort of tutorial on this ....but I learned enough to hopefully get me thru the next few labs. 
#Save and test, save and test. 
# exactly. the dot in the file should be your cue that the file isnt saved
# and I don't have to `learn submit` on this, right? 
# correct, cause I ran learn test for you, thats the command to run...not learn submit
# right, but once it passes, it will register in Github automatically? or i need to save it a final time?
# running 'learn test' should run the tests AND push your code up to github
# if you check your github repo it should show the new code above
# if i knew what github repo was, I would totally go check that out. 
# goa head and ipen up your github account
